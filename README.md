**Knowledge**

I won't provide the template here in case it gets updated later. Download the correct template from the course (https://utah.instructure.com/courses/1172144/files/185305446?module_item_id=30179402) and upload the template in the **Knowledge** section for the GPT.

**Recommended Model**

I selected the latest thinking model available when I recorded the video. You should be able to switch the model if you want.

**Capabilities**

I didn't change the defaults. (e.g., Web Search, Canvas, Image Generation)

**Actions**

I didn't specify any actions. (That option is currently inactive in the EDU account.)
